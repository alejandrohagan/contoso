 The Contoso dataset is a fictional set of data created by Microsoft. It is commonly used for educational and demonstration purposes to showcase various features of data analysis, business intelligence tools, and data processing techniques

This dataset is perfect for practicing time series analysis, financial modeling, or any business intelligence-related tasks.

Using view, you can see the columns' label using the [labelled](https://larmarange.github.io/labelled/index.html) package.^[Inspiration from [Crystal Lewis](https://cghlewis.com/blog/dict_clean/) excellent blog post]

The data is sourced from the [sqlbi](https://github.com/sql-bi/Contoso-Data-Generator-V2-Data/releases/tag/ready-to-use-data) github site 

## Dataset overview

The relationship keys that join each of the tables are listed below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: keys
#| message: true
#| error: false
#| warning: false

tibble::tibble(
    sales=c("order_key", "customer_key","store_key","product_key","currency_code")
    ,customer=c(NA,"customer_key",NA,NA,NA)
    ,product=c(NA,NA,NA,"product_key",NA)
    ,store=c(NA,NA,"store_key",NA,NA)
    ,order=c("order_key","customer_key","store_key" ,NA,NA)
    ,orderrows=c("order_key",NA,NA,"product_key",NA)
    ,fx=c(NA,NA,NA,NA,"from_currency")
) |> 
    tidyr::replace_na(list(sales="",customer="",product="",store="",order="",orderrows="",fx="")) |> 
    tinytable::tt() 

```

## Installation

You can install the development version of contoso from [GitHub](https://github.com/alejandrohagan/contoso) with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("alejandrohagan/contoso")
```

## Example

Example of how to create a duckdb database with Contoso tables loaded is below:


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: create-contoso-duckdb

library(contoso)

# Create a DuckDB database containing Contoso datasets
contoso_db <- create_contoso_duckdb(dir = "temp",size = "1m")

# Access the sales dataset from the database
sales_data <- contoso_db$sales

```
