It includes various supporting tables for business intelligence, such as customer, store, product, and currency exchange data.\nThis dataset is perfect for practicing time series analysis, financial modeling, or any business intelligence-related tasks.\nThe package comes with the following datasets:\n\n\nsales:\n\nContains information about sales transactions, including the total sales amount, customer, store, and product involved.\n\n\n\ncustomer:\n\nContains details about customers, such as customer key, name, address, and demographic information.\n\n\n\nstore:\n\nContains information about stores, including store key, name, location, and related details.\n\n\n\nproduct:\n\nContains information about products, such as product key, name, category, and price.\n\n\n\nfx:\n\nContains foreign exchange rate data, mapping currency pairs to their exchange rates on specific dates.\n\n\n\ndate:\n\nContains date-related information, including date, week, month, quarter, and year for use in time-based analysis.\n\n\n\norders:\n\nContains information about individual orders, including order key, customer key, order date, and store information.\n\n\n\norderrows:\n\nContains detailed line items for each order, including product key, quantity, and price for each item in the order.\n\n\n\nBuilt into the package is the 10K row version of the dataset.\nIf you want a larger dataset, there is also 100K, 1M and 10M which can be created with create_contoso_duckdb() function.\nThis will create a local duckdb database and attach the specified row size version from a motherduck database into your local database.\nUsing view, you can see the columns’ label using the labelled package.1\nThe data is originally sourced from the sqlbi github site\n\n\n\nContoso\n\nThe relationship keys that join each of the tables are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n      \n\nsales\n                customer\n                product\n                store\n                order\n                orderrows\n                fx\n              \n\n\norder_key\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  order_key\n                  order_key\n                  \n                \n\ncustomer_key\n                  customer_key\n                  \n                  \n                  customer_key\n                  \n                  \n                \n\nstore_key\n                  \n                  \n                  store_key\n                  store_key\n                  \n                  \n                \n\nproduct_key\n                  \n                  product_key\n                  \n                  \n                  product_key\n                  \n                \n\ncurrency_code\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  from_currency\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can install the development version of package from GitHub with:\n\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"alejandrohagan/contoso\")\n\n\nExample of how to create a duckdb database with Contoso tables loaded is below:\n\nlibrary(contoso)\n\n# Creates a list of DuckDB database containing Contoso datasets\ncontoso_db &lt;- create_contoso_duckdb(dir = \"temp\",size = \"1m\")\n\n# Access the sales dataset from the database\nsales_data &lt;- contoso_db$sales",
